                From May 11th - June 12th I was fortunate enough to recieve a bursary to participate in a 5 week intensive French immersion program. This took place at the University of Ottawa, and classes were held at La Cité collégiale. During this time I made some amazing friends from all across the country and learned more than I thought possible about the city of Ottawa and the French language.
